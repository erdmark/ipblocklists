#ipblocklists

Here you can find lists of ips and scripts to block or unblock these.

Everybody is allowed to add or remove entries.

On top of each file there has to be a description why to disallow these ips and they should be sorted by topics using a folder structure.

Try to use a header in each file similar to https://github.com/erdmark/ipblocklists/blob/master/google/googleIpBlockAfwall.txt
